Motion One is the smallest fully-featured animation library for the web.

It can animate HTML or SVG elements using the Web Animations API, which means some animations can run off the main thread. These animations will remain smooth, even while your website is busy rendering or processing.

Additionally, it can animate anything by passing it a custom function, like innerText or Three.js.

By the end of this quick guide, you'll have installed Motion One and created your first animation.

It's based on Motion One. [Website](https://motion.dev)
